* :completion company

This module adds completion support powered by [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company]].

+ Uses ~company-quickhelp~ for documentation tooltips
+ Uses ~company-statistics~ to order results by usage frequency

** Install
Specific languages may require additional setup. Some languages may have no completion support at all.

Check the README.org in that language's module for details.

** Customization
This module is configured to suit my preferences. Here are some things you may want to change:

*** as-you-type completion
By default, I've disabled auto-completion. This is my preference. I prefer to invoke company when I need it by pressing ~C-SPC~ from insert mode. Some don't like this.

To make it automatic, you need to do two things:

1. Load ~company~,
2. and change ~company-idle-delay~ to a non-nil float (the default is 0.5)

To do this, add the following to your ~modules/private/<username>~ module (remember, ~:private <username>~ needs to be added to init.el):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'company)
(setq company-idle-delay 0.2
      company-minimum-prefix-length 3)
#+END_SRC

** Troubleshooting
If completion isn't working for you, please consider the following before posting a bug report:

+ Different languages will have different dependencies in order for auto-completion to work. Please look for the README.org in that language's respective module for details.
+ Some languages don't have any auto-completion support.
+ Check [[*Customization][Customization]], perhaps what you are expecting is popup-as-you-type completion, which is disabled by default.
